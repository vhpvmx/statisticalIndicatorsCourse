# Statistics course applied to trading

Statistics seem boring to you, that's because they didn't teach us the right way.

In this repository I have the skeleton of a python program where you can add strategies to trade cryptocurrencies.

For the development of these strategies you will use statistical indicators such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, etc.

Your strategies can be tested in real time with real data and if you wish with real money!

Interested ?, keep in touch, soon I will publish a course where we will put into practice different strategies.

As auxiliary elements we have the program that is in charge of downloading the data of the prices of the cryptocurrencies with which we will do tests.

We will also use a database to store the historical data.
